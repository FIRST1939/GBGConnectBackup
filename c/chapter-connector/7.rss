            <p>Hello!<br>
I’ve started a GBG program with the Physical Therapist Assistant Club at Nassau Community College.  We modified and donated a car to the Children’s Learning Center at United Cerebral Palsy of Nassau County in May '21 and are now looking for families who would like a car in our area! We will be at the Nassau County Games for the Physically Challenged with a car on display on Friday June 2, 2023.<br>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Mom of an 18 month old who needs some mobility help, and we were recommended Go Baby Go from our PT.  I’m not really sure where to start with getting my LO set up, but we live in the Sacramento area in Northern California.</p>
<p>Not sure where or how to start.</p>
<p>I’d love to be connected to a nearby chapter (or as nearby as we can get).  I think between my husband and myself we could always try to build ourselves too.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi All, my name is Thomas, I moved to Colorado about a year ago for work and have been missing working with GoBabyGo.</p>
<p>I worked in a research lab at Oregon State University on designing some new cars and features for GBG so i’m very familiar with the process and organization. But I am hoping to help host a build event / presentation in Boulder, CO. Does anyone know of any local chapters or contacts in or near Colorado that could possibly be helpful?</p>
<p>Thanks so much <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"><br>

            <p>Hello everyone, my name is Rogelio and I wanted to announce that we have Go Baby Go available at the University of Houston Main Campus. I’m the project Co-ordinator this year and we just completed a car last semester. Although it’s not a club itself, UH-BMES (UH Biomedical Engineering Society) runs this project and partakes in what a normal GBG chapter does as part of our GBG project.<br>
If anyone has any inquiries, questions, and the such please don’t hesitate to reach out to me.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Rogelio Castilla.<br>
UHBMES Project Coordinator (2021-2022).</p>

            <p>Hello,<br>
I’m currently a senior attending Northern Highschool in Owings, Maryland, and was looking to start a new club at my school for GoBabyGo. I have a good number of people who would be interested in modifying the ride-on-cars for children, and would be able to find the money to cover the cost of the vehicle, but am unable to find a child who would be willing to receive such a thing, as getting in contact with mobility-limited children is quite difficult, as most pediatric centers are naturally reluctant to give out such information, and other efforts to reach out to potential receivers have proved futile. If you or anyone you know in the greater Washington, DC would like to receive a free modified ride-on-car tailored to their child’s condition and proportions, email me at <a href="mailto:s64653@calvertnet.k12.md.us">s64653@calvertnet.k12.md.us</a> looking forward to hearing from you!<br>
-Will</p>

            <p>Greetings from Wenatchee High School in North Central Washington state!</p>
<p>We waited a couple of years to make ourselves known because we wanted to make sure we truly making a sustainable impact on children in our community and state. We have had three successful custom car builds for kids in our school district and we have mentored two more schools in the state with their own custom builds.</p>
<p>It is our goal to create a custom build each semester at Wenatchee HS, and give away stock cars (We still have 7 to give away!) to schools in WA to start them on their own GBG program.  Doug Merrill has presented on GBG at three statewide conferences and has multiple school districts planning to start their own GBG program as students get back into the classroom.</p>
<p>WHS has adapted three vehicles a Ford F-150 for a boy with Spina Bifida, a Barbie convertible for a girl recovering from a brain tumor that had a “gear-shifter gas pedal” to encourage right arm movement, and a Wild Thing with lots of padding for a 12-year old with severe challenges. Each one had 3-4 design iterations and all are being used by their drivers to this day.</p>
<p>The only way that we have strayed from the original GBG concept car is that we use a green button, because our therapist said, "Green means Go!</p>
<p>Contact Doug Merrill at <a href="mailto:merrill.d@wenatcheeschools.org">merrill.d@wenatcheeschools.org</a> if you’d like to come to get a free car!  Sorry, we cannot ship cars.</p>

            <p>I am at the University of Wisconsin- Madison and am looking for anyone that knows of other builds in Wisconsin.  We get requests from all over the state and since our program is part of a service learning project for PT students, we only have 1 build a year and can only serve 8 kids.  We are limited due to student availability, space and faculty time.  I would like to be able to pass along information to other families that we are not able to serve.  thanks in advance and feel free to email me directly.  blonien@pt.wisc.edu</p>

            <p>I work for a Community Partnership in Rolla, Missouri. We are starting a GBG chapter along with students/professors at Missouri S&amp;T.  We would like to attend a workshop before we hold one ourselves. I have reached out to a few areas near us and haven’t gotten much feedback (Columbia, Springfield, St. Louis). Can anyone help with finding resources near me?</p>
<p>Thank you!<br>

            <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I work for Variety of Illinois and we’re trying to build an annual Go Baby Go event! I was hoping to put some feelers out and see if anyone had any guidance on people, schools, or organizations that would want to be involved? I’m new to the Chicago area and would love some guidance or tips on engineering schools, organizations and or specific names of people that have shown an interest in an annual Go Baby Go event!</p>
<p>In addition - does anyone have advice for someone that’s planning a new event? any guidance you wish you would’ve known prior to your first Go Baby Go?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>The Introduction to Engineering class at Gilford High School built their first 2 cars during spring 2019 for 3 students at our local elementary school. Since then, we’ve received a donation from an anonymous donor to continue buying 1-2 cars each year for the foreseeable future. Looks like we’re in the GBG business! Keep up the great work, everyone!</p>
