    <description>Topics in the &#39;Technical Discussion&#39; category The Technical Discussion category is the place to discuss best practices when it comes to the actual modification of ride-on cars or other devices for the purposes of GoBabyGo! This is where you should post questions and answers regarding safety, wiring, mechanical modifications, and any of the other technical aspects that come into play as we work together to provide greater mobility for children with special needs. All groups are encouraged to have cars or other devices inspected by a professional engineer before distributing them to the families.</description>

          <title>Help wiring Big Red Button to Frozen 12v SUV</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi, we just picked up a used Disney Frozen SUV 12v car and a Big Red button but I’m having trouble knowing which wires to cut, splice, remove, etc.</p>
<p>I have 2 kids who will be using this car. 1 needs the Big Red Button, the other will want to use the pedal. So, idealy I’d like both to be functional. Is that even possible?</p>
<p>It has 2 speeds + Reverse<br>
40A battery</p>
<p>The foot pedal has Red, Yellow and Black wires</p>
<p>I can only add 1 image for reference so it’s the wiring under the car. You’ll see the Red wire going from the pedal (into a relay?) and back into the battery, yellow going into the dash, and black going from the pedal to the dashboard to the battery. The other red, black, white and blue wires are running from the motors up to the dashboard.<br>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have a build that will require a 7 pound oxygen bottle. Does anyone have ideas on the best way to secure the bottle behind the seat? I want to make sure the bottle does not move around, is easy to install/remove, and the valve/connection point is protected from getting hit.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

          <title>Best Choice Jeep motors not activating</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>We did the wiring modifications to the Best Choice Jeep including kill switch and red button activation switch.  The vehicle was working when we left the build day.  It sat in my garage for about 2 months.  Now the motors will not activate.  I fully charged the battery.  The car turns on, and the switch gets power.  I removed the kill switch from the circuit to test, but the motors still do not activate.  The team that worked on this vehicle put the kill switch on the negative terminal wiring instead of the positive.  Is this the problem?  Did they fry something?  Any ideas are appreciated.  Thank you!</p>

            <p>Has anyone ever dissected one of the <a href="https://shop.mattel.com/products/power-wheels-toddler-6-volt-rechargeable-replacement-battery-p6828">blue 6v batteries</a> from the old Lightning McQueen cars? The upper section appears to be a separate plastic piece, and I suspect it’s just a cap covering the battery terminals.</p>
<p>We have a bunch of Lightnings with dead batteries. The replacements are absurdly pricey. If possible, I would like to salvage as much of that wire &amp; connector as possible and just put them on a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Casil-CA640-4Ah-Rechargeable-Battery/dp/B085TRXV9R/">standard 6V 4Ah battery</a>.</p>
<p>(To be clear, I am <strong>NOT</strong> advocating that anyone try dissecting a battery housing; just curious if anyone already has.)</p>

            <p>Hi everyone.<br>
I wanted to start a discussion to share models and thoughts on 3D printed parts that may be of use.</p>
<p>Here in GbG israel i designed a bunch of 3D parts, some we use in all builds and some only when required.</p>
<p>I would love to have any feedback on my own models and also hear from you guys what you use or would love to see modeled.<br>
What is the most time consuming task in your build?</p>

We have a Bentley EXP12 and we are stumped with the conversion!  We have located the wiring for the pedal and we see where the accelerator and power are connected.  We do not know if we need a relay or not, because we keep getting different information. We also need clarification of guage size for wires.</p>
<p>Thank so much</p>

            <p>we are adapting a kidzone and are leaning to move towards using this instead of cars, so the family can use indoors. We are in Chicago. Also want something EI therapists can put in their cars. I saw some directions on wiring, but no finished product. can i get more details please. Thanks</p>
<p>Also, how are folks comparing kidzone to wildthing?</p>

We wanted to see if anyone here had any other suggestions. We are fine with the coding and electronics, just looking for a  way to make a durable steering setup. Does anyone have any tips before we get started on this last part of this build?<br>
Thank you!</p>

the hitch we have run into this that there are three active wires in the foot pedal and all are active (no ground).  combining any two shut the system down.  we moved the foot pedal up to the wheel, but it is clunky and difficult to depress, so I would like to replace with a push button, but have not found one I could use. thoughts or suggestions?  car has a remote, so relay is already in circuit.<br>

            <p>My students have been building GobabyGo vehicles for a few years now, and we have a new challenge to work on. We are building an outdoor vehicle for a young man whose left side is affected by CP. He is taller than most of the children we have built for in the past. I am looking at a few UTV style 12 volt vehicles right now and am leaning towards the rzr900. Does anyone have one of these available to check a measurement for me? I need to know the distance between the footwall and the back of the seat to see if this vehicle will work before ordering. Most of the stores we have looked at have them available to order but nothing available in the store to physically check.</p>

            <p>Good morning everyone,</p>
<p>My name is Alyssa Gremban and I am an Assistant Professor at Touro University Nevada. My colleagues and I are working on creating a GBG Chapter for the Las Vegas area but are having difficulty connecting with someone who can assist us in the actual modification of the cars. I am an occupational therapist by trade and have participated in GBG builds before but my colleagues have not had the opportunity and therefore we would like to organize a “training” of some sort to give everyone the experience of modifying the cars before we launch our first build. We have reached out to the University of Delaware regarding their training program but have had difficulty getting in contact with anyone. Additionally, our engineering/robotics resources in the Las Vegas area (who are also familiar with GBG) are limited.</p>
<p>Could you please advise me on any next steps you would recommend?</p>
<p>Thank you and I look forward to connecting with you all!</p>

            <p>I am working to continue a couple wild thing builds with my STEAM students via digital conferencing during quarantine. We have improved the rear castor, and built our seat frames. I ordered a couple of seat/harness combinations from <a href="http://Wondergears.com" rel="nofollow noopener">Wondergears.com</a>.<br>
<a href="https://www.wondergears.com/products/child-secure-seatbelt-vest" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.wondergears.com/products/child-secure-seatbelt-vest</a><br>
Has anyone used these for their builds yet? The website has all the measurements posted online except for the overall width. I am trying to find out how wide the seat is at its widest point.<br>
Thanks for the help!!</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>All,</p>
<p>We’re developing a written protocol for repurposing used cars. I know some folks advise just replacing used batteries outright, but that seems wasteful. With that in mind, two related questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Other than the fact that the batteries hold charge less well over time, are there other reasons why it might be important to replace them before re-using them? Am I missing some safety issue with older batteries?</li>
<li>If it is safe to re-use an old battery, what are best practices for testing the battery before sending it back out into the world? Is it sufficient to charge the battery and slap a voltmeter on it? Are there other steps we could take to make sure the battery will hold a charge?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for any tips!</p>

            <p>Hello Fellow Modifiers!<br>
My chapter is trying to rewire this particular V6 vehicle for a larger kid. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZCSF57D/?coliid=I3NJPECVWK49UD&amp;colid=37UW93IBCMCWR&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZCSF57D/?coliid=I3NJPECVWK49UD&amp;colid=37UW93IBCMCWR&amp;psc=1&amp;ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it</a></p>
<p>The wiring is a little complicated for my small mind, but we are trying to go from a pedal to a reverse switch on the seat (when the child sits down, the car doesn’t go, when the child stands up, the car goes forward). One of the problems that (I think) I have is that the car needs to still be “on” but the “gas” needs to stop.<br>
Let me know if anyone get give me any advise! I’m not a wiring newbie, but I am especially not a pro…</p>
<p>Thanks a million!!!</p>

            <p>Our chapter has recently been asked to modify a car for a visually impaired child.

            <p>Hey Everyone!<br>
I am rewiring a Frozen car to make the foot pedal into a push button for hand control. But for this child, the car goes a little too fast. What can I buy/do in order to slow down the car a little bit? Thanks so much!</p>

            <p>One of my former students put together this awesome video about working with the Arduino as the control system for modifying a Wild Thing. Thanks to George Whitehill for the time and effort he put into this. Lots of info packed into a short time!</p>

            <p>Hello, non-electrical person here! I have read through many manuals. I’m wondering, does a trailer connector serve the same purpose as a relay? Are these interchangeable?<br>
Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hello, all!</p>
<p>We have a little lady who would benefit from a light-up switch to activate the car, as she is motivated by lights. Has anyone had success with a specific brand/company? We used one from “Health Products For You,” but it would stick in the “ON/activated” position, which is obviously not great. Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
