            <p>Hi,<br>
My name is Leo and I have completed the electrical modifications for my first car (Ford-150). I am looking for assistance as it relates to completing the car. I had an instruction manual for the electrical mods, is there a manual for the PVC roll cage and safety modifications? If not, I would love it if someone could zoom with me a couple times to assist and guide me in completing the car.</p>

            <p>Posting this in the hope it will save someone some time. We have been placing Maseratis lately, and one just showed up with a manufacturing defect. The symptom was “no sound”, not on startup nor from anything else. The problem was a power cable (yellow and black wires) that was manufactured “too short” but installed anyway .It comes from under the dash and runs into the under-hood area.  But it wasn’t long enough to reach the sound board (under the hood, right next to the speaker) so the assembler just left it hanging. Of course the fix is just to cut it, splice in some extensions, and plug the connector into the sound board. I apologize, I didn’t think to take pictures until mid-fix. But you can see what is going on. The power socket on the sound board is appropriately labeled B+ B-.</p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/gbgconnect/original/1X/8393c2292e75a2aa38792d7174b0eb18afd61d79.jpeg" title="S3900001.JPG" rel="nofollow noopener"><img src="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/gbgconnect/optimized/1X/8393c2292e75a2aa38792d7174b0eb18afd61d79_2_690x388.jpeg" alt="S3900001" width="690" height="388" srcset="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/gbgconnect/optimized/1X/8393c2292e75a2aa38792d7174b0eb18afd61d79_2_690x388.jpeg, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/gbgconnect/optimized/1X/8393c2292e75a2aa38792d7174b0eb18afd61d79_2_1035x582.jpeg 1.5x, https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/gbgconnect/optimized/1X/8393c2292e75a2aa38792d7174b0eb18afd61d79_2_1380x776.jpeg 2x" data-small-upload="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/gbgconnect/optimized/1X/8393c2292e75a2aa38792d7174b0eb18afd61d79_2_10x10.png"></a></div> <img src="https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/gbgconnect/original/1X/0a42ec71219105304c0d2e64e6815b501959c5fd.jpeg" alt="S3900002" width="690" height="388"><p></p>

          <title>I need a more sensitive switch for my child to activate</title>

            <p>I was at the GoBabyGo workshop in Charlotte, NC almost a week ago. My client got a larger Mickey Mouse car that could not use a big mack switch because the voltage on the car was too high. The alternative provided at the workshop that was compatible with the higher voltage is not a very sensitive switch. The child using it is weak.  Does anyone know anymore sensitive options for the switch.  The family is willing to purchase whatever will make this work for this child.</p>

            <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>We have some bigger kiddos on our list and are no longer able to purchase the Frozen (<a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Disney-Frozen-Convertible-Car-6-Volt-Battery-Powered-Ride-On/37312935" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.walmart.com/ip/Disney-Frozen-Convertible-Car-6-Volt-Battery-Powered-Ride-On/37312935</a>) cars, as they have been discontinued. Has anyone else successfully wired a car that is about the size of the Frozen 6 volt? Thank you in advance!</p>

          <title>Trucks with Cargo Space for Ventilator &amp; Suction?</title>

            <p>Hello, everyone! We’re looking for a good car/truck model for a child with a portable ventilator and suction. He needs some pretty substantial cargo space. We will do body work to support the equipment if needed, but thought we’d see if anyone knows of a model with sufficient space out of the box. We’ve already ruled out the 12-volt Jeep Wrangler and the 6-volt Ford Lil’ F-150.</p>
<p>The equipment dimensions are:</p>
<p>Vent - 14.5"W x 8"L  x 10"H<br>
Suction - 9"W x 7"W x 8"H</p>
<p>He’s okay to travel with only the vent if necessary. We would welcome any suggestions or measurements on vehicles you think might work!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
