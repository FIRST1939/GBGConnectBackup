            <p>We provided a vehicle to our local Children’s Hospital, and they requested that the pool noodles be covered so that the surface could be cleaned and disinfected.  Here is the product I found that has worked well.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ID-Black-Heat-Shrink-Tube/dp/B09B6YPT29/ref=sr_1_35?crid=3O3UXOBQC1KD8&amp;keywords=large+diameter+heat+shrink+tubing&amp;qid=1643737471&amp;sprefix=large+diameter+heat+%2Caps%2C418&amp;sr=8-35" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Amazon.com: 3" ID Black Heat Shrink Tube 2:1 ratio 3.0" wrap (4 feet) inch/ft/feet/to 80mm : Industrial &amp; Scientific</a></p>
<p>This length was enough to cover three uprights on the Best Choice Jeep seating frame (so one and a half vehicles).</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello!</p>
<p>An organization that helps fund our Milwaukee Go Baby Go branch has asked us to reach out to other GBG groups to ask the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Approximately how many cars per year does your branch modify and give out to families?</li>
<li>Approximately how much does it cost (car, button, additional parts) for your program to make one car?</li>
</ol>
<p>We would greatly appreciate any responses! If you’d prefer to email us directly at <a href="mailto:gobabygo@chw.org">gobabygo@chw.org</a>, that would be lovely, too.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>I worked with a seller on Etsy to create two spinning ring designs that I was going to promote as a fundraiser for a GBG group I was trying to start, but since COVID 19, I have retired from teaching and moved, and unfortunately the group never got off the ground. So if another group(s) would like to contact the seller about setting up a similar commission program, I think that would be great. One design is a car that spins around the ring and says “Go Baby Go”. The other ring has tire tread and looks like a tire rolling as it spins around the ring. It also says “Go Baby Go”. The Etsy shop is called KineticColorFoundry. Hopefully someone will get some use from this.<br>

            <p>Hi all,<br>
An FYI that I am gathering info towards a "GBG Launch Package’ document.<br>
Goal: to provide a one stop document to launching a chapter.</p>
<p>I have started a ‘GBG in the Schools’ thread on the UD GBG facebook and am working with a few STEM associations to get ready for wide spread blasts of the curriculum.</p>
<p>I will occasionally post here and on facebook issues related to GBG in the Schools.</p>
<p>The first is about teen communication</p>

            <p>Hello, I work out of the University of Vermont as a statewide PT consultant. We are trying to launch a statewide Early Mobility project, to promote access to early mobility across the state. We have so far worked with a local high school to modify a Wild Thing and have other community partners ready to help modify other cars as well. However, we are now in a holding pattern because our university is worried about the liability involved. We have informed them that we certainly aren’t the first University to be doing this, and have provided many examples, but they want more. Would anyone mind sharing how they cover liability? I saw KC’s liability form here (thank you!), but if anyone could share anything else about their liability journey with their institution it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! Tamra</p>

            <p>Saginaw Valley State University (SVSU) is starting a Go-Baby-Go chapter. Is there anywhere I can get open source logos to incorporate our school’s logo like other universities have done?</p>
<p>I took UofD’s logo and photoshopped it to fit our needs, but if we are going to publish a website, I don’t want to break any copywright laws.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi all,<br>
There are several reviews on early (birth - 5 yrs) powered mobility including a new whitepaper from RESNA.<br>
This newest review is an excellent (clear, comprehensive, well organized) overview of the theory and data on the impact of early powered (wheeled with motors) mobility on a range of ‘domains’ (aspects of a child’s inner and outer life).</p>

          <category>Best Practices</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Best Practices in my opinion help guide decisions. There may be exceptions but exceptions require additional rationale and critique.</p>
<p>The overall best practice guideline (IMHO) is that <strong>individuals participating in workshop builds (whether 3rd graders, graduate students or corporate event attendees) take PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY for the cars they modify.</strong><br>
This practice will result in families, children, tools, cars, event attendees and the event location being treated with compassion, care and consideration.</p>
<p>Other Best Practice thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Cars and attendance at the ‘workshops’ are free to families.</strong><br>
There may be circumstances where groups may have to require families to provide the car and/or parts of the modification kit (PVC, pool noodle etc.) but there should not be a ‘charge’ for the actual modifications.<br>
Certain individuals (examples: clinicians, teachers, admin) may<br>
a) be charged a fee for attendance.<br>
b) gain other perks for attendance - example, continuing education units.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A mechanical and/or electrical engineer should ‘sign off’ on the modifications.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Someone with significant knowledge of each child’s abilities should be present</strong> during the build. In addition to family, teacher and/or pediatric therapist are often helpful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A group’s initial workshop should be as easy and fun as possible.</strong><br>
This means the simplest cars, the less involved children, the fewer the cars and the less stress the better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Remind families that mobility is risky.</strong><br>
Both the children and families are gaining meaningful mobility through a modified car.<br>
This mobility may be completely new for them.<br>
A child with a toy car has the ability to move (likely faster, easier and over more ground than ever before) – so keep a constant eye on the driver!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When in (even the slightest) doubt about something, simply ask</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Have enough extra hands and eyes</strong><br>
This lessens the stress, increases the fun, gets questions answered and allow each family to be pampered just like they should be!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consider the liability.</strong><br>
Different groups address liability differently but all groups should discuss and address the liability of modifying cars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use only top quality cars</strong><br>
please seek out information from the other chapters/groups modifying cars as to which cars are low quality and simply do not use them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Thank those that share their information, and share what you learn!</strong><br>
Go Baby Go spreads rapidly due to the time, effort, compassion and skill of those who join the movement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Go bigger, build better, share broader!</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
