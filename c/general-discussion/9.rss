            <p>We have been asked to create a brochure to advertise our GoBabyGo Chapter here locally. We want to include pictures prominently, but would prefer not to use local kids living in our small town. We have photo releases from all of the kids we’ve seen here locally, but would prefer not to make them the local face of GBG.</p>
<p>Does anyone have GoBabyGo pictures that you would be willing to share for a brochure outside of your own market? We would need some assurance that you have appropriate releases for the pictures to be used.</p>
<p>Thank You!</p>

            <p>Hi!<br>
I am on OT that works in a school in a school in NY. We service children with multiple disabilities and are interested in building some GBG cars to use in our therapy programs- and possibly expand from there. Our administration has some concerns about liability with the adaptive cars.  Im wondering if anyone works in a school or hospital setting similar to our that uses these cars and can help us navigate how you handle liability with students.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This might be a longshot, but…</p>
<p>Is anyone using an inventory control system to keep track of your cars? Given the way our University is set up, we need to account for every car we send out into the world. We need some way to get ahold of families to get cars returned when kids outgrow them and it would be really helpful if we could document exactly what modifications went into each car. We’ve been using an excel spreadsheet, but honestly it’s a bit unwieldy. We’ve been looking at something like <a href="https://www.sortly.com/">Sortly</a>, but then there are all kinds of privacy issues with using a cloud provider.</p>
<p>How do you track your cars?</p>

I think it could be a good resource to prevent others from purchasing a vehicle that does not work out.  Feel free to add successes to this thread. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello, everyone!</p>
<p>I am working with a group of PT students at the University of Missouri to create a series of short YouTube videos that we can use to reinforce parent training for GoBabyGo cars. We want to create a different video to cover each of the areas of training we provide to parents. The goal is not to replace our existing training, but rather to give parents something to refer back to later if needed.</p>
<p>So far, these are the areas we are considering:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Switch Style (Floor Pedal, Big Red, Arcade Button, 3D-printed, sit-to-stand)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seating System (Lap Belt, 5-point Harness, PVC structure)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Control Mechanisms (“Kill” Switch, Gear Shift, On/Off Switch, Relays, Wild Thing controls)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Charging (Direct to battery, charging port)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training Activities / Play Ideas</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We have two questions for the GBGConnect community:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Specifically for the “Training Activities / Play Ideas” category, are there any activities you like to recommend to families? I generally default to saying, “Just play!” but I know some folks give more specific examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What else are we missing? Are there other training areas or specific common build options we should incorporate? If we are successful and open this up to broader use, what would make it useful to your chapter?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions!</p>

            <p>Hello -<br>
I’m curious to hear how other GBG sites are adapting their builds during the pandemic.  Is anyone doing remote builds?  If so, I would love to hear about your procedures.<br>
We have so many families looking for modified cars for their children, but are currently unable to host community members/builds due to our site’s pandemic restrictions.<br>

            <p>Hi<br>
I participated as a volunteer in the GBG event a few months ago in a neighboring county. I’d like to offer this program for children in my local area. How do I start?<br>

            <p>Today I went to the Abilities expo in Dallas. Was thrilled to see that one of the major manufacturers of chairs have come up with a prototype for the 0-3 child.  This is still awaiting FDA approval, but Cole Gallaway and Sam Logan, I bet you can tell us alot more about the features! It will be made by Permobil- it is currently call the Explorer Mini, and they are still pricing it, but it sounds a little steep to me.  I did want to share this though, for those of us who have been making joystick driven cars - the rep affirmed that what ever research they had done supported the use of a joystick over a single switch.   I apologize for the pictures- they do wonky things when I try to upload them…</p>

            <p>I attended a conference with Sam Logan, a professor at Oregon State.  He discussed using a “Fun Scale”.  I am unsure how to contact him and want to apply using that (if Ok) to our grant.  Does anyone have access to the “Fun Scale”?  Essentailly, we are looking for inventories to measure improvement in any area because a child participated in go baby go. Any help would be appreciated.<br>
thank you,<br>

            <p>Working on GoBabyGo cars with my students has been the most rewarding thing I’ve done in my career. I have seen how it can teach empathy, user-centered design, and so much more. Inspired by my work with GBG, I wanted to do something to expand the number of people we can help while also expanding the number of students that are involved in using their STEM skills to help others.</p>
<p>So, over the summer, my wife Andrea and I worked with the International Technology and Engineering Educators Association (ITEEA) to put together REACH Challenge. This is an adaptive/assistive technology project that comes with a unique toolkit with units covering Adaptive/Assistive Technology, Empathy, User Centered Design, and much more.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reachchallenge.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.reachchallenge.org</a></p>
<p>This project gives student teams a chance to help a member of their community and submit their project to earn recognition, free attendance at the ITEEA Conference in Baltimore, and a cash prize of $2000 for the top entry. There are divisions for Middle, High School, and Collegiate levels.</p>
<p>Feel free to post questions or feedback!</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am a GBG mom and graduate student in the Technical Communication program at Minnesota State University, Mankato. I am currently conducting research on how do-it-yourself/consumer technology/go-tech helps to impact the user experience of individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p>My research is survey and interview based, and will help to uncover how DIY technology and modifications are used to shape our user experience. If you are interested in participating, please send me an e-mail at krissy.jackson@mnsu.edu and I will provide instructions and an introduction to my research to help you decide if you would like to participate.</p>
<p>Thanks so much!</p>

            <p>We have recently started a chapter here in Hershey, PA, however are in the beginning stages and looking to expand. Given that this is a large hospital/facility, there are many steps and processes we must go through to keep on growing the chapter from a legal and financial standpoint per policy. In order to have the appropriate liability in place, we have to develop documents and protocols for the overall process of selection, wiring, seat modifications, etc. I was curious if anyone would be willing/able to share with use the “behind the scenes” information from your chapter. If you’re willing and interested in helping us, we would greatly appreciate it.</p>

            <p>Good afternoon,<br>
I am in Memphis, and this is my first time being involved with the Go Baby Go program. This is also my school’s first year doing anything with the program. Could you please give me any advice on choosing the models or hardware that are easiest to modify, most reliable, cheapest, etc. The school we are paired with is in their second year of doing it, but I am kind of shooting in the dark from the engineering side. Any advice, help, or general comments are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>To give a little more background, the two main things that need modifications are gas pedal to a push button, the seats need to be modified to be more safe, and there needs to be something to reduce the acceleration and deceleration. Other than that, we are wanting to look into providing a remote kill switch as well as any other things that might be beneficial to the kids as well as their parents.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br>

            <p>HI!  I have been slammed with referrals lately.  I do most of my own builds, but am at the point where I need to get help.  While I have a few people wanting to volunteer, what is the best way to get volunteers?  Also, when those of you are doing builds, how do you best use your volunteers?  I am trying to standardize and have written instructions with pictures for everything, but this takes time, and each vehicle is made for a specific child’s needs…Any thoughts or suggestions???</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I’m working to start a Go Baby Go program at the Middle School where I am a Technology Education Teacher.  I am wondering if anyone has liability and/or release forms that they use and would be willing to share.  The Physical Therapist I’m working with is requesting a release form so she can discuss the child who will be receiving the car with myself and my students.

            <p>We are looking to modify this Jeep as well as several of the Maserati Cars for our upcoming community build and Hack-a-thon in November. It’s big, but seems like a very cool car. We especially like that it has a remote.</p>

<p>Anyway, just wondering if anyone has built these before and seeing if you have any insights, tips, or ideas to contribute. We’ll make sure to post a manual once we have it ready!</p>
