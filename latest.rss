          <title>Help wiring Big Red Button to Frozen 12v SUV</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi, we just picked up a used Disney Frozen SUV 12v car and a Big Red button but I’m having trouble knowing which wires to cut, splice, remove, etc.</p>
<p>I have 2 kids who will be using this car. 1 needs the Big Red Button, the other will want to use the pedal. So, idealy I’d like both to be functional. Is that even possible?</p>
<p>It has 2 speeds + Reverse<br>
40A battery</p>
<p>The foot pedal has Red, Yellow and Black wires</p>
<p>I can only add 1 image for reference so it’s the wiring under the car. You’ll see the Red wire going from the pedal (into a relay?) and back into the battery, yellow going into the dash, and black going from the pedal to the dashboard to the battery. The other red, black, white and blue wires are running from the motors up to the dashboard.<br>

          <title>Adding an oxygen bottle to a 6v car</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have a build that will require a 7 pound oxygen bottle. Does anyone have ideas on the best way to secure the bottle behind the seat? I want to make sure the bottle does not move around, is easy to install/remove, and the valve/connection point is protected from getting hit.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi,<br>
We are planning a GBG event in Ithaca, NY.  I have been looking through the available manuals and then looking at what vehicles are available online.  It does not look like lightning mcqueen or towmater are available anymore and I also did not see power wheels that were available with car option for a single driver, it looks like they are all 2 seat options.  I saw on the walmart website they have a lot of different brands of cars that are single seats, would the wiring still be the same with a different brand?  What has everyone else been using?<br>
Thanks,<br>
Kimber</p>

          <title>Best Choice Jeep motors not activating</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>We did the wiring modifications to the Best Choice Jeep including kill switch and red button activation switch.  The vehicle was working when we left the build day.  It sat in my garage for about 2 months.  Now the motors will not activate.  I fully charged the battery.  The car turns on, and the switch gets power.  I removed the kill switch from the circuit to test, but the motors still do not activate.  The team that worked on this vehicle put the kill switch on the negative terminal wiring instead of the positive.  Is this the problem?  Did they fry something?  Any ideas are appreciated.  Thank you!</p>

            <p>Has anyone ever dissected one of the <a href="https://shop.mattel.com/products/power-wheels-toddler-6-volt-rechargeable-replacement-battery-p6828">blue 6v batteries</a> from the old Lightning McQueen cars? The upper section appears to be a separate plastic piece, and I suspect it’s just a cap covering the battery terminals.</p>
<p>We have a bunch of Lightnings with dead batteries. The replacements are absurdly pricey. If possible, I would like to salvage as much of that wire &amp; connector as possible and just put them on a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Casil-CA640-4Ah-Rechargeable-Battery/dp/B085TRXV9R/">standard 6V 4Ah battery</a>.</p>
<p>(To be clear, I am <strong>NOT</strong> advocating that anyone try dissecting a battery housing; just curious if anyone already has.)</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Mom of an 18 month old who needs some mobility help, and we were recommended Go Baby Go from our PT.  I’m not really sure where to start with getting my LO set up, but we live in the Sacramento area in Northern California.</p>
<p>Not sure where or how to start.</p>
<p>I’d love to be connected to a nearby chapter (or as nearby as we can get).  I think between my husband and myself we could always try to build ourselves too.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi All, my name is Thomas, I moved to Colorado about a year ago for work and have been missing working with GoBabyGo.</p>
<p>I worked in a research lab at Oregon State University on designing some new cars and features for GBG so i’m very familiar with the process and organization. But I am hoping to help host a build event / presentation in Boulder, CO. Does anyone know of any local chapters or contacts in or near Colorado that could possibly be helpful?</p>
<p>Thanks so much <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"><br>

            <p>Hi everyone.<br>
I wanted to start a discussion to share models and thoughts on 3D printed parts that may be of use.</p>
<p>Here in GbG israel i designed a bunch of 3D parts, some we use in all builds and some only when required.</p>
<p>I would love to have any feedback on my own models and also hear from you guys what you use or would love to see modeled.<br>
What is the most time consuming task in your build?</p>

            <p>We have been using Spark Motor Controllers in most of our builds. I see that Rev Robotics lists them as out of stock currently, and we have two wild things that lack only that part to be completed. Does anyone have a suggestion for a direct replacement?<br>

            <p>Hi all<br>
We have a Bentley EXP12 and we are stumped with the conversion!  We have located the wiring for the pedal and we see where the accelerator and power are connected.  We do not know if we need a relay or not, because we keep getting different information. We also need clarification of guage size for wires.</p>
<p>Thank so much</p>

            <p>Hello,<br>
I’m currently a senior attending Northern Highschool in Owings, Maryland, and was looking to start a new club at my school for GoBabyGo. I have a good number of people who would be interested in modifying the ride-on-cars for children, and would be able to find the money to cover the cost of the vehicle, but am unable to find a child who would be willing to receive such a thing, as getting in contact with mobility-limited children is quite difficult, as most pediatric centers are naturally reluctant to give out such information, and other efforts to reach out to potential receivers have proved futile. If you or anyone you know in the greater Washington, DC would like to receive a free modified ride-on-car tailored to their child’s condition and proportions, email me at <a href="mailto:s64653@calvertnet.k12.md.us">s64653@calvertnet.k12.md.us</a> looking forward to hearing from you!<br>
-Will</p>

            <p>Hey GoBabyGo Connect family. I’ve been a long time lurker and learner from all of you. A few months back, my son and I built our first adapted ride-on and he’s been loving it. We finally got around to developing a very high-level how-to video, with more of a focus on inspiring others to try and build their own - trying to convey… it’s not that scary.</p>
<p>Would love to answer any questions you have about our project. Video is below.</p>

            <p>We had so much help from Doug Merrill in Wenatchee this year that we adapted 5 ride-on cars this spring.  Thank you so much <a class="mention" href="https://www.gbgconnect.com/u/room408">@Room408</a></p>
<p>Can anyone tell us how to create our own Chapter in Redmond, WA and if it is necessary?   Thanks so much.</p>

            <p>We have been asked to create a brochure to advertise our GoBabyGo Chapter here locally. We want to include pictures prominently, but would prefer not to use local kids living in our small town. We have photo releases from all of the kids we’ve seen here locally, but would prefer not to make them the local face of GBG.</p>
<p>Does anyone have GoBabyGo pictures that you would be willing to share for a brochure outside of your own market? We would need some assurance that you have appropriate releases for the pictures to be used.</p>
<p>Thank You!</p>

            <p>we are adapting a kidzone and are leaning to move towards using this instead of cars, so the family can use indoors. We are in Chicago. Also want something EI therapists can put in their cars. I saw some directions on wiring, but no finished product. can i get more details please. Thanks</p>
<p>Also, how are folks comparing kidzone to wildthing?</p>

            <p>Hi!<br>
I am on OT that works in a school in a school in NY. We service children with multiple disabilities and are interested in building some GBG cars to use in our therapy programs- and possibly expand from there. Our administration has some concerns about liability with the adaptive cars.  Im wondering if anyone works in a school or hospital setting similar to our that uses these cars and can help us navigate how you handle liability with students.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br>
