        <title>Help wiring Big Red Button to Frozen 12v SUV</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Bill_Janes William E. Janes]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Andrew,</p>
<p>That picture helps a lot! That is indeed a fuse (or more accurately, a circuit breaker). You want to keep that intact.</p>
<p>If Google is right, you’re in south Florida? There are some great robotics teams and GoBabyGo chapters up in Gainesville and Tampa, but that probably doesn’t help much. They might be able to put you in touch with someone closer. Feel free to email me at janesw@missouri.edu and I’ll try to connect you!</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Thanks for your response Bill.</p>
<p>I don’t know of any team nearby that could help but I should look into that.</p>
<p>I’ve attached what is on the red box between the wires<br>

<p>I’ll add the only picture I currently have of the relays in the dashboard. Those black boxes are connected to the “gear stick” that selects hi/low speed and reverse.</p>

        <title>Help wiring Big Red Button to Frozen 12v SUV</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Bill_Janes William E. Janes]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Welcome, Andrew!</p>
<p>I haven’t wired this particular car, so I’m not certain, but a couple of thoughts…</p>
<p>That box at the end of the red wires in your first picture is probably a fuse. Does it have any markings on it? If it were a relay, it would have more wires running to/from it. I can’t tell from the picture, but the black object directly above that in the picture looks like an automotive relay.</p>
<p>You definitely want the Big Red wired to a relay. This is helpful in 6v cars, necessary in 12v cars. What you want (both switches operable) is possible, but we don’t have enough information on the wiring to give good advice. Do you have a robotics team nearby you could ask for some hands-on assistance?</p>
<p>Good Luck!<br>
Bill</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Help wiring Big Red Button to Frozen 12v SUV</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Andrewleif Andrew Leif Hanssen]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hi, we just picked up a used Disney Frozen SUV 12v car and a Big Red button but I’m having trouble knowing which wires to cut, splice, remove, etc.</p>
<p>I have 2 kids who will be using this car. 1 needs the Big Red Button, the other will want to use the pedal. So, idealy I’d like both to be functional. Is that even possible?</p>
<p>It has 2 speeds + Reverse<br>
40A battery</p>
<p>The foot pedal has Red, Yellow and Black wires</p>
<p>I can only add 1 image for reference so it’s the wiring under the car. You’ll see the Red wire going from the pedal (into a relay?) and back into the battery, yellow going into the dash, and black going from the pedal to the dashboard to the battery. The other red, black, white and blue wires are running from the motors up to the dashboard.<br>

        <title>New Car/Vehicle Recommendations</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Bill_Janes William E. Janes]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Kimber,<br>
I’m sorry for not seeing this post sooner! Unfortunately, I haven’t seen any new build guides in quite a while. The wiring is not always identical, particularly when you get into models with lots of options (e.g.: variable speed, independently switch-operated lights and sounds, and especially remote controls). Remote controlled cars are particularly tricky.</p>
<p>This is where a local robotics team can come in handy. They are really good at working through the wiring of a car and figuring out exactly how to modify it.</p>
<p>This makes me think we may want to start producing and collecting some new build guides…</p>
<p>Take Care,<br>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>You could simply get a bigger battery with more capacity. Doesn’t have to be on brand but you will have to do some light wiring work to make the connections work.<br>
There are lots of conversion kits that let you use a standard Lithium ion battery from Milwaukee or dewalt. So if you have a standard set of tools with Li Ion that’s an option and just bring multiple batteries with ya.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Go Baby Go Buffalo NY</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Eyesofibad Bill Brown]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hi!  I’m brand new to this.  I live in Rochester, NY.  My 4 year old daughter has a form of muscular dystrophy that includes short stature and muscle weakness.  We were just given an off brand power wheels by a neighbor which is incredible for her independence.  She loves it, but the battery lasts at best about an hour.  It doesn’t look particularly easy to get to (for getting an extra battery and swapping out when it gets low).  I’d love to be able to use this (or something like it) for festivals, walks around town, etc.  The speed is great and this model has an adjustable seat so it fits her great.  I’m looking for a way to either swap batteries easily, or somehow increase the drive time to several hours worth of driving.  Do you have any suggestions?</p>
<p>I’m not opposed to simply getting a different model if it seems the easiest way to do this but in my Google search for “disabled child hot wheels” this is the first thing that came up.</p>

        <title>Adding an oxygen bottle to a 6v car</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@ddegrendel Dan DeGrendel]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I have a build that will require a 7 pound oxygen bottle. Does anyone have ideas on the best way to secure the bottle behind the seat? I want to make sure the bottle does not move around, is easy to install/remove, and the valve/connection point is protected from getting hit.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

        <title>New Car/Vehicle Recommendations</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@kmk Kimber Kurr]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hi,<br>
We are planning a GBG event in Ithaca, NY.  I have been looking through the available manuals and then looking at what vehicles are available online.  It does not look like lightning mcqueen or towmater are available anymore and I also did not see power wheels that were available with car option for a single driver, it looks like they are all 2 seat options.  I saw on the walmart website they have a lot of different brands of cars that are single seats, would the wiring still be the same with a different brand?  What has everyone else been using?<br>
Thanks,<br>
Kimber</p> ]]></description>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@mkwillison Katie]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>The switch (the big red button) has a light that will light up if you plug the wires into the correct connectors.  That light is lit, so there is current going to the big red button.  I will borrow a multimeter since changing out the breakers that are in line with the motors did not work.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Yes, I agree with you. Usually if the manufacturer puts a removable seat in the car, removing that gives access to wiring and a place to mount the motor controller. Based on the picture you sent, I do not recall working on that exact car, although similar ones were easier to work from the top. One other thing you might discover that way is that it actually has two motors. In which case my approach has been to install two motor controllers, one on each motor. You can sometimes make do with one, but I like two better.</p>
<p>One other thing I wanted to ask based on what I saw in the picture – are you located in Connecticut? Or did you get ideas for your car from someone there?</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I second Pete’s suggestion of testing the circuit. It’s quite possible the battery is not holding a charge, even if it’s fairly new. What do you mean when you say the “switch gets power”? Wiring the kill switch on the negative terminal rather than positive should make no difference; it’s just breaking the circuit.</p> ]]></description>
