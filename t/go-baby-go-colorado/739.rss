    <title>Go Baby Go Colorado!</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/go-baby-go-colorado/739</link>
    <description>Hi All, my name is Thomas, I moved to Colorado about a year ago for work and have been missing working with GoBabyGo. 

I worked in a research lab at Oregon State University on designing some new cars and features for GBG so i&#39;m very familiar with the process and organization. But I am hoping to help host a build event / presentation in Boulder, CO. Does anyone know of any local chapters or contacts in or near Colorado that could possibly be helpful?

Thanks so much :slight_smile: 
Sincerely,
Thomas</description>
