    <description>Hey All!

Dr. Sam Logan brought the GBG to Oregon State University in 2014. Since then, GBG Oregon was formed as an equal partnership between Dr. Sam Logan (sam.logan@oregonstate.edu) with Oregon State University and Dr. Bethany Sloane (sloaneb@ohsu.edu) with Oregon Health &amp; Science University and receives significant contributions from an established GBG Oregon committee. 

Please feel free to email either one of us if you are a family interested in applying to receive a modified ride-on car, or if you are a student/community member interested in volunteer opportunities.

We keep our Facebook page updated with news and events!
