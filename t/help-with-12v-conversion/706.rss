    <title>HELP with 12v conversion</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/help-with-12v-conversion/706</link>
    <description>Hi all
We have a Bentley EXP12 and we are stumped with the conversion!  We have located the wiring for the pedal and we see where the accelerator and power are connected.  We do not know if we need a relay or not, because we keep getting different information. We also need clarification of guage size for wires.

Thank so much</description>

            <p>Hi!<br>
If the car has a remote control, then a relay is already in.  If not, it probably needs one.  I can put you in touch with our electrician if needed.<br>
