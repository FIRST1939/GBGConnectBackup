    <description>Seeking physical and occupational therapists who are involved in providing modified ride-on cars (MROCs) to young children with disabilities.

This study should take no more than 45 minutes to complete. If you are interested in participating, please click on the link below. There is a potential risk of loss of confidentiality in all email, downloading, electronic meetings, and internet transactions. Participation is voluntary.

            <p>I participated in this survey and recommend it to all OTs and PTs here! It took me less than 45 minutes (don’t worry!) and asks some really insightful questions about MROC’s. If you are an OT or PT who does GoBabyGo, please take the time to participate!</p>
