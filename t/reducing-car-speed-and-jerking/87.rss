    <title>Reducing Car Speed and Jerking</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/reducing-car-speed-and-jerking/87</link>
    <description>Sometimes we have a car that goes too fast for the child, or starts with a jerk that scares the child. We then install a motor controller and that solves both problems. It was surprising how the controller would slowly accelerate to the speed where the potentiometer was set, giving a nice smooth ride. One caution. Some cars come with a non-standard noise control circuit on the motors, utilizing an NP electrolytic. Those are not compatible with this controller. We would just replace that with a standard circuit, but if you don&#39;t want to do that you should check the motor first and avoid any cars with that circuit.

We bought ours on Amazon, the link is below.

            <p>Yes, I agree with you. Usually if the manufacturer puts a removable seat in the car, removing that gives access to wiring and a place to mount the motor controller. Based on the picture you sent, I do not recall working on that exact car, although similar ones were easier to work from the top. One other thing you might discover that way is that it actually has two motors. In which case my approach has been to install two motor controllers, one on each motor. You can sometimes make do with one, but I like two better.</p>
<p>One other thing I wanted to ask based on what I saw in the picture – are you located in Connecticut? Or did you get ideas for your car from someone there?</p>

            <p>Good. Yes, it is very straight-forward. If you have any questions about checking the polarity of the wires with your multi-meter, let me know and we can shift to step-by-step. That is critical and really the only place someone could make a mistake with this mod.</p>

            <p>OK, sounds good. For a 6v car, buy this motor controller:<br>

<p>I have used this kind for several years with pretty good luck.</p>
<p>Also, on this particular board, the screw connections that don’t go to the motor are usually labeled “Power” instead of “Input”.</p>

            <p>OK, the first thing to try is adding a DC motor speed controller to the car’s motor. This is relatively easy. You cut the two wires going to the motor. There are 4 screw connectors on the controller. The two wires still going to the motor go on the “Motor” screws; the other two on the “Input” screws. You have to determine which of the wires supplies positive voltage to the motor and which is ground. Do you have a multimeter available? Then just be sure you put the positive color wires on the two + screws, and the negative color on the two - screws. Then you adjust the speed of the car with a knob on the controller. This also slows the start-up jerk. The controllers cost about $16 on Amazon. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=riorand+7-70v+pwm+dc+motor+speed+controller+switch+30a&amp;crid=9L3H42IB277P&amp;sprefix=rioran%2Caps%2C94&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_3_6" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.amazon.com/s?k=riorand+7-70v+pwm+dc+motor+speed+controller+switch+30a&amp;crid=9L3H42IB277P&amp;sprefix=rioran%2Caps%2C94&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_3_6</a></p>
<p>Now, is this a 12v car or a 6v car? The link I gave you above will probably work on the 12v car but may not work on a 6v car. Also, these controllers are “one way” – they will allow the car to move forward, but if the car has a “reverse”, don’t out the car in reverse or it may burn something out.</p>

            <p>Sorry for the delay.    the issue we are having is when you push the button it’s 100% full throttle. it jerks and scares my son. if we can have it be more smooth and slow we would be in good shape. I might be able to get a video also. I also know very little about these things but Im sure i can figure it out with your help and a video. I build computers and networks all day so Im some what handy.<br>

            <p>Sure, happy to help. Could you first tell me what you are trying to achieve with the car and how you planning to go about it? As I look back through the thread, it seems like the most recent poster wanted to slow the car down but also wanted to use an Arduino to do it. We have slowed down a previous version of the F150 just using a pair of RioRand motor controllers, and that was a a simpler modification. The general approach is described in the older part of the thread, 2017-2019. Would you please start by sending me some pictures of the truck and the exact model number?<br>

            <p>Hi Molly,<br>
Yes, we have hit this one too. In practice, one way you can encounter such a problem is if the parents let the battery run down, and then if the child stalls the car  the voltage to the electronics can drop. This is one thing to test before you release the car, make sure it just shuts down and doesn’t do anything unexpected.</p>
<p>You have several options. First, there are indeed Arduinos that operate at lower voltages. I will try to attach some scans from Make’s Guide to Boards and you can see some where the input voltage can be as low as 3.7 volts. Maybe one of those will meet your needs.</p>
<p>If none of those boards are satisfactory, you can power just the Arduino board (not the motor controller board) from a separate small battery. Either wire in a separate on/off switch for that, or use a relay to turn it on when they turn the car on.</p>
<p>You can also buy a voltage step-up board that will increase the voltage from what the battery is supplying to what the electronics needs. I will try to attach a scan of one such board, you can read what it will do. There are a lot of these available, this one costs $7.</p>
<p>Hope this is helpful!</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
– Doug</p>

            <p>Hi Doug,</p>
<p>I am looking into Arduino-based controller options to slow down the initial acceleration of a car. The problem I am running into is that the car only has a 6V battery, and from what I have read online arduino’s need at least 7V. Have you run into a similar problem? Do you have any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Pat and I discussed this. Any possibility it’s the motor noise that bothers him? Those cars actually are pretty noisy (and therefore scary)  for some kids, especially if the child is autistic. Maybe the parents want to see if he would tolerate some comfortable hearing protectors?</p>

            <p>Oh wow! In all the other builds I’ve seen that have Arduino controllers, the board itself is at least $100, so I kinda just assumed this would be the same <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/smirk.png?v=9" title=":smirk:" class="emoji" alt=":smirk:">. I’m not sure if it’s the jerking or the fact that he’s moving himself through space (having never done that before) that scares him so I need to figure that out first. I will definitely let you know if it seems like your new board would help. Thank you so much!</p>

            <p>Hi Kathy,<br>
Oh, if you decided one would help, I’d just send you one when we have them ready. They will be cheaper to build than the commercial controllers – about $10 for the parts. That was part of the goal. I don’t intend to charge for them.  But I assume for the child you are working with, there is still a lot the parents can do to acclimate him – pushing him around in the car without turning it on, etc. Let me know if you eventually need to try something like we are working on.<br>
Best regards,<br>
– Doug</p>

            <p>Hi Doug -<br>
That sounds great, but expensive. My program’s funding was cut for this next year, so there’s no money to buy anything. I bought the two motor controllers out of my own pocket because they were inexpensive, but I’m not sure how I feel about buying an Arduino-based controller. We do expect full funding next year so perhaps I can convince the higher ups at that time. Thank you for the offer, though!</p>

            <p>Hi Kathy,<br>
First, congratulations on getting the controller to work. Now you have another option available for when needed. Sorry to hear the little guy is still unhappy with it. We may have another option available soon. Nick and I have been working on an Arduino-based controller timer that gives even smoother operation than the commercial controllers. Plus it can be programmed for any sort of speed limit and speed ramp-up that you want.  Maybe that would make your little guy become comfortable with the car more quickly. This will be in an experimental phase for a while yet, but we would consider working with someone who could keep a close eye on it while in use, at least to start. Maybe the parents you are working with here would be candidates if they are really serious about this.  I have a couple of videos of a prototype in operation, but Go Baby Go Connect will not let me post them on this site. If you are interested, send me an alternate email address and I can either email them to you directly or put them up on a Google Drive.<br>
Best regards,<br>
– Doug</p>

            <p>Update:<br>
I successfully wired the controller &amp; pot into the car and brought it to my little guy. Aaaaannnnd, he’s still scared of it, even when it’s moving really slowly <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/frowning_face.png?v=9" title=":frowning_face:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning_face:">. His parents are troopers, though, and are committed to getting him used to it. I’m going to do this again for another of my kids and see what he thinks.  Thanks for all the help!!</p>

            <p>Hi Kathy,</p>
<p>Your best option is to find a location where you don’t have to extend any of the wires, but I usually do have to lengthen the power wires. It’s best to keep them as short as possible, but adding a few inches of the same gauge wire is not going to hurt anything.</p>
<p>My strong preference for adding extension wires is to solder them and put heat shrink tubing on. But this has to be done by someone who really knows how to solder well, and most of our volunteers did not.  A good solder connection is the most reliable and trouble-free; a bad solder joint is the worst.</p>
<p>It is possible to use wire nuts to add the power wire extensions if you can’t arrange to get them soldered well, as long as you can get them tight enough. We have had trouble with wire nuts long term if the volunteers didn’t get them tight.</p>
<p>There are also other ways to add wire extensions, but when compared to a good solder joint, every other approach has some kind of higher risk associated with it.</p>
<p>Try hard to avoid the need to extend the potentiometer wires. It is far better to extend the power wires a little more to avoid extending the potentiometer wires.  Find some compromise between the placement of the motor controller board and the location of the potentiometer so you don’t have to do that. Reorient the motor controller board so the potentiometer wire connector faces the potentiometer. You can even mount the motor controller vertically on the sides of the motor compartment if that helps. I have extended those potentiometer wires myself when I had a very strong reason to do so, but that’s really risky. It can make the motor controller act erratically. I would really like to say “never do it”, but if you have no other choice, keep the extensions as short as possible, use solder, and be sure to test the car very thoroughly, at various speeds.</p>
<p>Hope this is helpful.<br>
Best regards,<br>
– Doug</p>
