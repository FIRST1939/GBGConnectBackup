    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/gobabygo-new-zealand/34</link>
    <description>Gobabygo New Zealand is in it&#39;s third year and is made up of a small group of 5 friends, We are sponsored by Rotary, Zyber and BMW cars so all our toy cars look like X5 BMW&#39;s. 
We would love to be able to adapt a car with joy stick control so all and any help is very much appreciated. 
We also want to find more kids to give cars to, our main age group is 1 to 6 but we have given cars to small 8 year olds.
Have a great day being the best you can</description>

            <p>Do the wires go from the switch to the board, and then to the motors?  I played with a little car called a Space Rider- had 2 motors in the back, but ran on 6 volts.  It has a remote as well, but the remote steers thru the back wheels. Despite what an engineering friend said, I was able to wire a digital joystick by removing  the switches, giving it fwd, right turn (right wheel reversed) and left turn (left wheel reversed). I wanted to maintain the remote control feature, and didn’t want to gut the car and add a new board that could run both. It was pretty simplistic, but achieved what I wanted. I would think you could do something similar to this by just messing with the wiring. Do you have a wiring schematic?</p>

            <p>Hi, Cars are 12 volt, with a steering motor and 2 motors,one on each back wheel. we have played around with the remote to use as a joystick but the parents quite often want to use the remote and have a joy stick for the child, Thanks</p>

            <p>HI!  Are your cars 6 volt or 12 volt?  With the built in remote, does it run a separate stepper motor in front to steer the car, while a single back motor propels the car, or are there 2 motors in the back?<br>
Also, instead of hacking the car, have you considering modifying the remote?</p>

            <p>Hi Gavin, This is the model car that we use, <a href="http://www.bbjtoys.com/goods.asp?product_id=573" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.bbjtoys.com/goods.asp?product_id=573</a><br>
we get all the extras, blow up tires, leather seat, mp3 player, radio, digital remote and buy a container at a time which is 78. hope this helps.</p>

            <p>The joystick we used was fine, but for this application you might want something sturdier. Might have a look at these: <a href="https://na.suzohapp.com/products/joysticks/">https://na.suzohapp.com/products/joysticks/</a></p>
<p>Also, could you post a link to the cars you use with the power steering? It was a pretty involved process to add power steering to the car we did.</p>

            <p>Thanks Gavin, Our cars come with a digital remote and the cars already have a motor on the steering. So we need to figure out how to build and connect the joystick, I will have a look at how you have done it and hopefully it is an easy fix, Thanks</p>

            <p>So cool to see a post from down under! The joystick modification is an important one since so many kids have difficulty steering. Our FIRST Robotics team (FRC 1939) did one last year with a VEX Robotics rack gear and motor to turn the wheels and used an Adafruit trinket as our controller. The link to the Instructables we made is <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Frozen-Car-Modification/">HERE</a> and also posted under manuals. Please let us know how your build goes. It was a challenge, but really fun for us!!</p>
