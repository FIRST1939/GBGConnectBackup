            <p>Hi Everyone!</p>
<p>Late to the party but…<br>

Thanks!<br>

            <p>Yep. I was pretty late to that party. Sorry, it’s been a busy time around here. That said, it is pretty easy for me to look up FRC Teams in any area through The Blue Alliance website.</p>
<p>Here is a link:<br>

            <p>Here is a link to all the FIRST Robotics teams in North Carolina. I’m guessing one of them would be happy to build a car for the family you’re talking about.</p>
<p>Here’s a map with the team list underneath.<br>

            <p>I tracked down the guy organizing the build/s and got the family hooked up, but not sure if there’s a “sustained presence” there.  But at least now I know who I’d ask <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Hi Pete.  Did you have any luck finding NC chapters?  There have been several build events recently in NC and I am wondering if it has spurned some new chapter activity.</p>
