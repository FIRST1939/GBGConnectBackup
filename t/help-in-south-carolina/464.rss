            <p>Amy,<br>
Go Baby Go in Greenville is up and running!  We have some cars ordered and some more pledged.  If you want to email me, we can start discussing what style car and what modifications your son might need.  <a href="mailto:katie.willison@prismahealth.org">katie.willison@prismahealth.org</a></p>

            <p>We are getting close here in Greenville!  We are planning our first car modification soon.  We will see how that goes, and then hopefully start growing from there.  Check back with me around October if I don’t get in touch with you before that!</p>

            <p>Hi, Amy.  This is probably way late for your son, but I am just starting to look into what it would take to start a group in Greenville.  Did you end up finding somewhere to help with his car?</p>
