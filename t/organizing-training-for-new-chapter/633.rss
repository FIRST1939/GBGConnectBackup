    <title>Organizing Training for New Chapter</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/organizing-training-for-new-chapter/633</link>
    <description>Good morning everyone,

My name is Alyssa Gremban and I am an Assistant Professor at Touro University Nevada. My colleagues and I are working on creating a GBG Chapter for the Las Vegas area but are having difficulty connecting with someone who can assist us in the actual modification of the cars. I am an occupational therapist by trade and have participated in GBG builds before but my colleagues have not had the opportunity and therefore we would like to organize a &quot;training&quot; of some sort to give everyone the experience of modifying the cars before we launch our first build. We have reached out to the University of Delaware regarding their training program but have had difficulty getting in contact with anyone. Additionally, our engineering/robotics resources in the Las Vegas area (who are also familiar with GBG) are limited. 

Could you please advise me on any next steps you would recommend? 

Thank you and I look forward to connecting with you all!

Alyssa</description>

            <p>Hi Allison,<br>
Sure, I am happy to help. I just sent a direct mail to the address you have me below. Let’s see if that works and then we can decide where to go next.<br>
Best regards,<br>

            <p>Hi Doug!<br>
We are a new chapter starting in Arkansas and I am looking for information for the evaluation process determining the type of modifications kiddos will need. Is this something you can help me with? Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:Allison.young@acheedu.org">Allison.young@acheedu.org</a></p>
<p>Thank you so much!</p>

            <p>Yes, it is certainly OK. I enjoyed talking with you. There is a lot we can still discuss, like the technical aspects that we’re really interested in. I have one specific suggestion regarding the therapist. Probably you already thought of this, but your District looks pretty large so you probably have a PT and/or OT already on staff somewhere. While we want to adapt this car on behalf of a separate healthcare provider and create a relationship with them, the school therapists can give you contacts. Let me know how it goes with the Principal. You have a really good proposal in this program and there will be a lot of benefits.<br>
Best regards,<br>
– Doug</p>

            <p>Good morning Doug,<br>
It was nice to talking to you yesterday. I will talk to Principal sometime this week and hopefully a therapist as well.</p>
<p>I will be in touch with you afterwards if it is ok.<br>
Thank you again for your helping me and many others.</p>

            <p>Sure, Sept. 6 will work. Shall we say 1PM ET? My wife Pat has a Zoom account we can use if you are willing to send me the email you would like to use for an invitation. Again, remember that I am primarily involved in the engineering aspects of GBG but I assume that aligns with your interests, too, correct?<br>

Thank you for the response. I believe I would get hold of them and meet them soon but in case I’d like to learn from you as well can we do anytime during the day  on Sept 6th if  that works for you too!</p>

            <p>Sure. Sorry to hear the local chapter was not more responsive. We have had such troubles here occasionally too, and COVID does not help. Next week I am out of town. I have some time available between Sept 5 to Sept 14. depending on the day. The first step would be for us to come up with a list of topics you would like to cover. I think we can easily make up such a list by email even while I am traveling, and of course it is not necessary to cover everything in one session. Let me know, OK?<br>
Best regards,<br>
– Doug</p>

            <p>Hi Alyssa,<br>
Sounds good. I am sure NuMotion will be able to bring in the training you need. If it turns out that there is anything I can do to supplement that, just let me know. What is your overall schedule and what car(s) are you planning to adapt first?<br>

            <p>Hi Doug,</p>
<p>Thank you for your help! I was able to get ahold of our local chapter of NuMotion and it sounds like they might be able to help us coordinate a training. However, I would still love to connect with you in case we need additional supports if you are willing! Via Zoom is fine… at this point, we are adept at virtual trainings. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Thank you again for your willingness to help!</p>

            <p>Hi Alyssa,<br>
I am willing to help, although it may be limited. I do the engineering work for Go Baby Go Central Ohio, a program of Adaptive Sports Connection. I have written a couple of manuals on how to modify certain cars. We have had to get creative due to COVID, and maybe we can do the same here. We now do a lot of our work (including evaluations of children to determine the required modifications to the cars) via Zoom. Perhaps we can do some training by Zoom as well, especially techniques like connecting wires or PVC pipes. Sort of like the cooking shows on TV. If you would like to explore this as an option, let me know.<br>
Best regards,<br>
– Doug</p>
