    <title>2019 GBG Build and Hackathon - Kansas City</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/2019-gbg-build-and-hackathon-kansas-city/525</link>
    <description>We just hosted our annual GoBabyGo Community Build and Hackathon here in Kansas City! This is the result of a partnership between the VarietyKC Children&#39;s Charity and FIRST Robotics Team 1939 from the Barstow School. 

We built 22 cars including 6 specialized cars, one of which was (as far as we know) the first time a hoverboard has been converted to a GoBabyGo car. We built for 3 kids that were over the age of 10 at this build and provides some interesting challenges. Also, received some great news coverage. Check out the links below.
