    <title>Local Chapters - Where to Find Them</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/local-chapters-where-to-find-them/202</link>
    <description>Hi all, 

I am a practicing Physical Therapist located in Northern California near Sacramento. 

Can someone point me in the direction of where I can find resources outlining contact info, locations, etc. of GoBabyGo! Chapters local to me?

From what I have been able to gather, there are none in this area. If that is truly the case, then I may be interested in starting a NorCal Chapter.

Thanks so much for your help!
