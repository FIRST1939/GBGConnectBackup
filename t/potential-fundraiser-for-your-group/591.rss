    <title>Potential fundraiser for your group</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/potential-fundraiser-for-your-group/591</link>
    <description>I worked with a seller on Etsy to create two spinning ring designs that I was going to promote as a fundraiser for a GBG group I was trying to start, but since COVID 19, I have retired from teaching and moved, and unfortunately the group never got off the ground. So if another group(s) would like to contact the seller about setting up a similar commission program, I think that would be great. One design is a car that spins around the ring and says “Go Baby Go”. The other ring has tire tread and looks like a tire rolling as it spins around the ring. It also says “Go Baby Go”. The Etsy shop is called KineticColorFoundry. Hopefully someone will get some use from this.
