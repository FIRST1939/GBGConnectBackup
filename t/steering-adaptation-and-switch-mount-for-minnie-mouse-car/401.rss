    <title>Steering adaptation and switch mount for Minnie Mouse car</title>

    <description>Hi everyone,

I am an occupational therapy graduate student, and this spring I have been partnering with FIRST Robotics Team 2363 (Triple Helix) to develop assistive devices for people in our community. We designed a steering modification and switch mount that allow for simultaneous propulsion and steering, using additional limit switches on each side of the steering column. 

Here is a link to the Triple Helix publication page with a description and a link to download the STEP file: http://team2363.org/2019/04/accessible-controls-for-ride-on-toy-car/
