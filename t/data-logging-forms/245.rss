    <title>Data Logging Forms</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/data-logging-forms/245</link>
    <description>Has anyone developed or discovered any resources that include a data log form for use of the GBG cars? Looking specifically for a form that was sent home with parents that they used to report information about their child and how long they used their car during the study time. 

Thank you!</description>
