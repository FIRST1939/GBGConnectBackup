    <title>Frozen Car Modification - Single Joystick Drive</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/frozen-car-modification-single-joystick-drive/15</link>
    <description>Here is a link to an Instructables Manual that was created by FIRST Robotics Team 1939. This manual describes how to add power steering and joystick drive to a standard Fisher Price Frozen PowerWheels Car (or any other standard PowerWheels car). This was a complex modification, but it was a lot of fun.
