    <description>Hello, 

We are conducting a research study that aims to understand the barriers and facilitators that faced in building modified ride-on cars, so we can learn what kind of tools and software we can build to improve the building process. 

The interview will take place on Skype, and it will last for 1 hour. Audio recording is optional. Information from the semi-structured interviews will be transcribed in a manner that de-identifies any of your responses before being passed back to the faculty involved in this study. Demographical information will not be gathered. 

If you are interested in participating, please email: rmalharb@ucsd.com

Best,</description>
