    <title>GBG Curriculum in Schools</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/gbg-curriculum-in-schools/204</link>
    <description>Hi all,
An FYI that I am gathering info towards a &quot;GBG Launch Package&#39; document.
Goal: to provide a one stop document to launching a chapter.

I have started a &#39;GBG in the Schools&#39; thread on the UD GBG facebook and am working with a few STEM associations to get ready for wide spread blasts of the curriculum.

I will occasionally post here and on facebook issues related to GBG in the Schools.

The first is about teen communication</description>

            <p>We are writing a grant for funding for GBG in our school.  A curriculum component would be very helpful to include.  Can you send me a link to your curriculum?  Even a draft copy would give me a place to start.  Thank you so much!</p>
