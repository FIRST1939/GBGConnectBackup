    <description>The Introduction to Engineering class at Gilford High School built their first 2 cars during spring 2019 for 3 students at our local elementary school. Since then, we&#39;ve received a donation from an anonymous donor to continue buying 1-2 cars each year for the foreseeable future. Looks like we&#39;re in the GBG business! Keep up the great work, everyone!</description>
