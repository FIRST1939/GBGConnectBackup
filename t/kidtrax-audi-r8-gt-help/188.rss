    <title>KidTrax Audi R8 GT help</title>

    <description>Hello Everyone,

I am looking to modify a KidTrax Audi R8 GT with 6v battery for one of my patients with a switch; basically disconnecting foot pedal and making it switch controlled. However, the wiring is much more complicated than the McQueen car and TMNT truck that I modified during Sam Logan’s course...Has anyone completed this modification or one similar to this? Also, does anyone have electrical engineering expertise that could provide input? Thanks so much!</description>
