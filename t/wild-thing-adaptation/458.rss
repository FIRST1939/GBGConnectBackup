    <title>Wild Thing Adaptation</title>

    <description>Hello everyone! I am working on adapting Fisher-Price Power Wheels® Wild Thing. I read the blog of [Reverse Engineered Wild Thing](https://bobparadiso.com/2018/03/16/reverse-engineered-wild-thing/), and want to do the similar modification that controls the wild thing with mechanical switch running in a lower speed.

I have the Arduino connect to the low pass filters and an operational amplifier. The Arduino controls the voltage output on green and black wire which means velocity and on-off signal. However, with a same voltage output, the power wheel behaves differently, please see the video: [Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10bNjikXH4Q43Zh4ewBhVHdbKjqtdmV-3/view?usp=sharing)

Just want to ask if anyone runs into a similar situation or knows how to deal with it?</description>
