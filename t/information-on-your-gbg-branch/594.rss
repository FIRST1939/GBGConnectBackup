    <title>Information on your GBG Branch</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/information-on-your-gbg-branch/594</link>
    <description>Hello!

An organization that helps fund our Milwaukee Go Baby Go branch has asked us to reach out to other GBG groups to ask the following:

1. Approximately how many cars per year does your branch modify and give out to families?
2. Approximately how much does it cost (car, button, additional parts) for your program to make one car?

We would greatly appreciate any responses! If you&#39;d prefer to email us directly at gobabygo@chw.org, that would be lovely, too.

Thanks!
