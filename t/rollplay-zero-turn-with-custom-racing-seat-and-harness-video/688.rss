    <title>Rollplay Zero Turn with Custom Racing Seat and Harness (Video)</title>

    <description>Hey GoBabyGo Connect family. I&#39;ve been a long time lurker and learner from all of you. A few months back, my son and I built our first adapted ride-on and he&#39;s been loving it. We finally got around to developing a very high-level how-to video, with more of a focus on inspiring others to try and build their own - trying to convey... it&#39;s not that scary. 

Would love to answer any questions you have about our project. Video is below.
