    <title>Go Baby Go Houston</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/go-baby-go-houston/718</link>
    <description>Hello everyone, my name is Rogelio and I wanted to announce that we have Go Baby Go available at the University of Houston Main Campus. I’m the project Co-ordinator this year and we just completed a car last semester. Although it’s not a club itself, UH-BMES (UH Biomedical Engineering Society) runs this project and partakes in what a normal GBG chapter does as part of our GBG project.  
If anyone has any inquiries, questions, and the such please don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

Best Regards, 

Rogelio Castilla.
UHBMES Project Coordinator (2021-2022).</description>
