    <title>New car for the 0-3 range</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/new-car-for-the-0-3-range/528</link>
    <description>Today I went to the Abilities expo in Dallas. Was thrilled to see that one of the major manufacturers of chairs have come up with a prototype for the 0-3 child.  This is still awaiting FDA approval, but Cole Gallaway and Sam Logan, I bet you can tell us alot more about the features! It will be made by Permobil- it is currently call the Explorer Mini, and they are still pricing it, but it sounds a little steep to me.  I did want to share this though, for those of us who have been making joystick driven cars - the rep affirmed that what ever research they had done supported the use of a joystick over a single switch.   I apologize for the pictures- they do wonky things when I try to upload them.....
