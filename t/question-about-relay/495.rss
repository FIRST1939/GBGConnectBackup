    <title>Question about relay</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/question-about-relay/495</link>
    <description>Hello, non-electrical person here! I have read through many manuals. I&#39;m wondering, does a trailer connector serve the same purpose as a relay? Are these interchangeable? 
Thank you!</description>

            <p>Hi,<br>
Actually they are very different and have different uses. The relay lets a small electrical current control a larger current. A trailer connector temporarily connects two electrical circuits that do not need to be permanently connected. When modifying cars, we use a relay to allow a switch (like a Big Red Button that cannot handle too much current) to turn on the car’s motor (which takes a lot more current). We sometimes use a trailer connector to temporarily connect a battery charger to the car if it doesn’t come with a convenient charging jack.<br>
Hope this is helpful!<br>
