    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/go-baby-go-chapter-in-alvarado-texas/679</link>
    <description>My non-profit is located in Ohio and I had a family reach out to me in Alvarado which is not too far from Dallas or Fort Worth.  Are there any groups that might be able to help them?  If so, email me at natalie@replayforkids.org</description>
