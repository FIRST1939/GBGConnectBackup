    <title>I need a more sensitive switch for my child to activate</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/i-need-a-more-sensitive-switch-for-my-child-to-activate/260</link>
    <description>I was at the GoBabyGo workshop in Charlotte, NC almost a week ago. My client got a larger Mickey Mouse car that could not use a big mack switch because the voltage on the car was too high. The alternative provided at the workshop that was compatible with the higher voltage is not a very sensitive switch. The child using it is weak.  Does anyone know anymore sensitive options for the switch.  The family is willing to purchase whatever will make this work for this child.</description>

            <p>we have also found that many of the 12 V cars that come with remote controls have relays already built in, which has solved the problem for us.  I would like to know about experiences with proximity switches as we are just starting to investigate this.</p>

            <p>Mary Beth’s “tech guy” here. The Sabertooth probably is overkill for what you need. I agree with the recommendation to install an automotive accessory relay and a light-touch switch from AbleNet. If you can tell me exactly what car you’re working with, I will try to write up some instructions for you. It’s really not that difficult. BTW, we ALWAYS use relays (or a Sabertooth, which is sort of a really fancy relay) to protect the switch from having to carry to full current. It’s just a safer way to go.</p>

            <p>Like other folks have already said, good habit to use a relay. You could also wire a 3.5mm switch jack into your setup … then use whatever AbleNet-type switch your kiddo can manipulate successfully <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/wink.png?v=6" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>I agree with you, Doug. Soon before my involvement in Go Baby Go, my school (CCSU) started using relays because it helped prevent buttons from getting damaged. But you may have to be careful if the car is running on a higher voltage because we found that the relays we had used would melt in larger cars. Currently we are using industrial strength relays which have shown no problems and have saved us much time and stress.</p>

            <p>You might consider adding a relay. Take a look at the drawing chaamy posted here: <a href="https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/issues-with-modifying-lightning-mcqueen-toy-car-bigger-version/151">Issues with modifying Lightning McQueen Toy Car (bigger version)</a><br>
The correct drawing is at the bottom.<br>
If you find the mechanical switch is not sensitive enough, you can use a proximity switch instead. For that, you would also have to add the relay as well.<br>

            <p>Have you considered stepping down the voltage on the car? I was given a car for my clinic that was way too fast and we stepped down the voltage to slow it down. So it is not too difficult to do.</p>

            <p>I was at the GoBabyGo workshop in Charlotte, NC almost a week ago. My client got a larger Mickey Mouse car that could not use a big mack switch because the voltage on the car was too high. The alternative provided at the workshop that was compatible with the higher voltage is not a very sensitive switch. The child using it is weak.  Does anyone know anymore sensitive options for the switch.  The family is willing to purchase whatever will make this work for this child.</p>
