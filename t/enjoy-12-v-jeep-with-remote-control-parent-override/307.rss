    <title>EnJoy 12 V Jeep with Remote Control/Parent Override</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/enjoy-12-v-jeep-with-remote-control-parent-override/307</link>
    <description>If anyone has used this model, have you had issues with the steering motors?

We bought 2. One works great. Much less wiring modifications needed but one stopped working quickly. 

Any insight with the steering motor would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,</description>
