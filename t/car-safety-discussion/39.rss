    <description>Seems like there are lots of different things to think about regarding the safety of the GBG Cars from harnesses to wiring. What are chapters doing to make sure the cars are safe going out the door?  

We have an electrical engineer present at our builds to make sure that the wiring is done correctly. We have also found that industrial strength Velcro makes for great seatbelts/straps. Just looking for insights from others on this.</description>
