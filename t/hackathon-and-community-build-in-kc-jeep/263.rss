    <title>Hackathon and Community Build in KC - Jeep?</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/hackathon-and-community-build-in-kc-jeep/263</link>
    <description>We are looking to modify this Jeep as well as several of the Maserati Cars for our upcoming community build and Hack-a-thon in November. It&#39;s big, but seems like a very cool car. We especially like that it has a remote.

Anyway, just wondering if anyone has built these before and seeing if you have any insights, tips, or ideas to contribute. We&#39;ll make sure to post a manual once we have it ready!</description>
