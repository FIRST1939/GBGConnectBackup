    <description>Thought it would be a good idea to share thoughts, findings, brainstorms, stories, goals, presentations, and resources from the UNF Summit this weekend.  I’d like to start off by thanking Juan, Mary, and Amanda from the University of North Florida for organizing and planning this event. I know there are many other GBGers out there that weren’t able to attend, so hopefully you will all still be able to use some of these shared resources to help further your program.</description>
