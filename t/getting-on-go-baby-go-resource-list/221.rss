    <title>Getting on Go Baby Go resource list</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/getting-on-go-baby-go-resource-list/221</link>
    <description>Hello all.  I tried to email  udgobabygo@udel.edu to get added to the Midwest resource list, and the email bounced.  Any idea who I should contact to get added?  Also, I was looking for a resource in the Chessapeake, VA area and there was not one listed.  Anyone in this group in that area and could modify a jeep for a family?

Thanks!</description>
