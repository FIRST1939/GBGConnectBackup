    <description>Hello GoBabyGo Group,

I saw an article about the work the group does on facebook recently and signed up right away, I have alway wanted to use my skills to help the dissabled and this is a great way to start.

I am an electronics technician with seven years experiance in the pharmaceutical QC/RD field of Install, Maintance, Repair and validation as well as five years of electronics design, fabricaton and testing working on the National Spherical Torus Experiment Upgrade (PPPL NSTX-U).

I also work in stem education by teaching electricity and magnetism four times a year to 3rd graders in the area, being a tour guide at a US National Laboratory and as a judge at the Mercer County Science and Engineering fair (and anything else that sneeks in).

My goal is to get up to speed here and use eventually start making prostetics out of high end RC hobby parts.

I look forward to working together with all of you.

Best, 
Kevin Lamb</description>

            <p>Wow. Sounds like you have the background to be VERY successful in this field. Welcome to GBGConnect. Look around, ask questions, and let us know how things go with your builds! Where is Mercer County? Have you checked to see if there is a chapter in your area?</p>
