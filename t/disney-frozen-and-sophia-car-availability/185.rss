    <description>Hello all

I am finding that the Disney Frozen and Sophia cars (that use the same base design) are unavailable at every outlet.  Does anyone have any insight into if this is temporary or if they are being discontinued?  I have a student group creating custom decal designs, and this was the base they were using, so I hate to have them start over!</description>
