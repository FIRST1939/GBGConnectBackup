    <title>Substitute for Frozen Cars</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/substitute-for-frozen-cars/252</link>
    <description>Hello everyone! 

We have some bigger kiddos on our list and are no longer able to purchase the Frozen (https://www.walmart.com/ip/Disney-Frozen-Convertible-Car-6-Volt-Battery-Powered-Ride-On/37312935) cars, as they have been discontinued. Has anyone else successfully wired a car that is about the size of the Frozen 6 volt? Thank you in advance!</description>

            <p>Great! Thank you both. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/slight_smile.png?v=6" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> We have heard that Disney Lightning McQueen by Huffy is another viable option (<a href="https://goo.gl/Tim6vd" rel="nofollow noopener">https://goo.gl/Tim6vd</a>).</p>

            <p>I haven’t gotten into the wiring yet, but the Disney Princess Mercedes 6-volt is almost identical to the frozen, just Pepto pink. I have one in the office; will try to verify that the wiring is the same.</p>

            <p>We are getting ready to hold a community build in November and we are working to find a car to replace the Frozen car. We like the Maseratis, but they are a little on the small side (but bigger than the little Lightning McQueen cars). We’ll put together a manual and post it in <a class="hashtag" href="https://www.gbgconnect.com/c/5-manuals-and-guides">#<span>manuals-and-guides</span></a> once we decide what to do with the kids that are over about 3 years old. We’re thinking about a Jeep, but they are bigger. I’ll try to keep you posted once we make a final decision.</p>
