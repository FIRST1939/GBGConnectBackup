    <description>Hello!
I&#39;ve started a GBG program with the Physical Therapist Assistant Club at Nassau Community College.  We modified and donated a car to the Children&#39;s Learning Center at United Cerebral Palsy of Nassau County in May &#39;21 and are now looking for families who would like a car in our area! We will be at the Nassau County Games for the Physically Challenged with a car on display on Friday June 2, 2023.
