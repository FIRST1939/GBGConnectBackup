    <title>GBG, DIY Technology and User Experience Research - Want to Help?</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/gbg-diy-technology-and-user-experience-research-want-to-help/476</link>
    <description>Hello,

I am a GBG mom and graduate student in the Technical Communication program at Minnesota State University, Mankato. I am currently conducting research on how do-it-yourself/consumer technology/go-tech helps to impact the user experience of individuals with disabilities. 

My research is survey and interview based, and will help to uncover how DIY technology and modifications are used to shape our user experience. If you are interested in participating, please send me an e-mail at krissy.jackson@mnsu.edu and I will provide instructions and an introduction to my research to help you decide if you would like to participate. 

Thanks so much!</description>
