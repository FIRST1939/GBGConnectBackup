    <title>Disney Princess Mercedes...help!</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/disney-princess-mercedes-help/468</link>
    <description>I modified a car in December for a kiddo with just a big red button switch and added a toggle on/off switch for safety reasons. It was working well but a few months ago mom stated it was not holding charge or working well. I called the company and they sent a replacement motor and battery. This worked well for a few weeks, but now it is doing the same thing and not giving any power, most of the time barely moving when the switch is pushed. Has anyone experienced anything like this with this car or others. Any help/advice would be great!! :slight_smile:

Thanks so much,

            <p>Thank you all for your responses. I sent mom home with the charger we have for our clinic car (they are identical). We will see if that works since it was the easiest thing to try first and then go from there. I will post what we determine to be the cause, if we can figure it out.</p>

            <p>Emily,<br>
One other thought. There have been cars where for one reason or another I needed to wire the kill switch into the battery line. Of course in that case, the kill switch must be turned on when charging. Any chance you chose to wire the car that way and the parents are not putting the switch in the right position to charge?<br>

I had a similar thing happen on a Maserati, same symptoms. It turned out to be a defective charger. The mother thought she was charging the car, but nothing was actually happening. Of course, as others have responded, a short can certainly do this too.<br>

            <p>You can check to see if it is pulling amps when the car is in the off position. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2NLYydxbo4" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2NLYydxbo4</a></p>

            <p>There may be an electrical short somewhere in the system. If you havent already, look closely at all the wiring you’ve done to make sure no metal wire exposed.</p>
