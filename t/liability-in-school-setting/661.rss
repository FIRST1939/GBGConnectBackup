    <title>Liability in School setting</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/liability-in-school-setting/661</link>
    <description>Hi!
I am on OT that works in a school in a school in NY. We service children with multiple disabilities and are interested in building some GBG cars to use in our therapy programs- and possibly expand from there. Our administration has some concerns about liability with the adaptive cars.  Im wondering if anyone works in a school or hospital setting similar to our that uses these cars and can help us navigate how you handle liability with students. 

Thanks!
