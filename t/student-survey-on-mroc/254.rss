    <title>Student Survey on MROC</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/student-survey-on-mroc/254</link>
    <description>Hi All, 
 Reaching out because would love to receive some feedback for our students to investigate!
Modified ride on cars are increasingly described in the literature as an intervention that can promote mobility, postural control, and social interaction in children with a variety of health conditions.  As third year DPT students, we are interested in learning more about how physical therapists are integrating the use of modified ride on cars into regular clinical practice.  We are therefore asking therapists who are currently treating, or have previously treated, a client who has a modified ride on car (MROC) to consider completing this 10-minute survey.
Our hope is that this survey will add evidence about the use and usability of the MROC as an intervention tool by therapists in the community.  The survey will also give insight into the benefits seen by pediatric physical therapists related to the use of the MROC. The participation of all pediatric physical therapists with clients who have MROC would be greatly appreciated.
