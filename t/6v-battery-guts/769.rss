    <title>6v Battery Guts</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/6v-battery-guts/769</link>
    <description>Has anyone ever dissected one of the [blue 6v batteries](https://shop.mattel.com/products/power-wheels-toddler-6-volt-rechargeable-replacement-battery-p6828) from the old Lightning McQueen cars? The upper section appears to be a separate plastic piece, and I suspect it&#39;s just a cap covering the battery terminals.

We have a bunch of Lightnings with dead batteries. The replacements are absurdly pricey. If possible, I would like to salvage as much of that wire &amp; connector as possible and just put them on a [standard 6V 4Ah battery](https://www.amazon.com/Casil-CA640-4Ah-Rechargeable-Battery/dp/B085TRXV9R/).

(To be clear, I am **NOT** advocating that anyone try dissecting a battery housing; just curious if anyone already has.)</description>
