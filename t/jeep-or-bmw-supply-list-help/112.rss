Hi,
My clinic is planning to adapt two Go Baby Go cars.  We wanted to do a Jeep and a BMW.  We got plans from Shirley Ryan for both cars, but they don&#39;t include a supply list.  Do you by any chance have one that we could use?  Thanks so much for your assistance.</description>

            <p>Dear Jennifer,</p>
<p>In order to help come up with the kind of list you need, we’ll probably need to get a better idea from you what kind of modifications you plan to add to the vehicles … in terms of seating requirements, method of accessing controls, etc etc.</p>
<p>Let’s just start with the make and model of the Jeep and BMW.  Are they 6 volt or 12 volt power systems?  Do they have power to both rear wheels or just one?</p>
<p>Happy to walk you through this … we’ll just eat this elephant one bite at a time <img src="https://discourse-cdn-sjc1.com/standard6/images/emoji/google/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>
