    <title>GoBabyGo Photo Request for Brochure</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/gobabygo-photo-request-for-brochure/682</link>
    <description>We have been asked to create a brochure to advertise our GoBabyGo Chapter here locally. We want to include pictures prominently, but would prefer not to use local kids living in our small town. We have photo releases from all of the kids we&#39;ve seen here locally, but would prefer not to make them the local face of GBG.

Does anyone have GoBabyGo pictures that you would be willing to share for a brochure outside of your own market? We would need some assurance that you have appropriate releases for the pictures to be used.

Thank You!</description>
