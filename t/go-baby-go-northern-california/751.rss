    <title>Go Baby Go - Northern California</title>
    <link>https://www.gbgconnect.com/t/go-baby-go-northern-california/751</link>
    <description>Hello, 

Mom of an 18 month old who needs some mobility help, and we were recommended Go Baby Go from our PT.  I&#39;m not really sure where to start with getting my LO set up, but we live in the Sacramento area in Northern California.

Not sure where or how to start.

I&#39;d love to be connected to a nearby chapter (or as nearby as we can get).  I think between my husband and myself we could always try to build ourselves too.

Thank you!</description>

            <p><a href="https://sites.udel.edu/gobabygo/contact/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Contacts In Your Area | GoBabyGo!</a> … this is hella old but there’s a chance that even if the person/chapter no longer active they might know who they’ve “passed the torch” to.  If you can’t find anyone to help local i’d be willing to try and help remotely <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/wink.png?v=12" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>Best of luck,<br>
